       "To promote active learning and to provide students with an opportunity to apply computational thinking in context, one suggested activity could be to conduct a simulation of an aerospace engineering project using Python. This could be a project where students simulate the trajectory of a spacecraft during a launch sequence. \n",

They start by defining the initial conditions, such as velocity and position, and then apply the equations of motion to predict the trajectory of the spacecraft. This activity can be broken down into the following steps:\n",

       "2. Implement and solve these equations using Python, NumPy, and SciPy.\n",

It includes steps such as defining system parameters (mass, spring constant, damping coefficient), writing the differential equation using SymPy, solving it numerically with SciPy, plotting displacement over time with Matplotlib, changing system parameters to observe different types of motion, and calculating total mechanical energy for energy conservation. This tutorial aligns with the course objective of analyzing and calculating vibrations in mechanical systems, making it a valuable resource for students.\n",

      "\n",
      "The activity can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start by explaining the mathematical formulation of heat conduction problems and the concept of finite difference methods.\n",
      "2. Guide the students to implement a Python function to solve a 1D steady-state heat conduction problem using the finite difference method. The function should take as input the thermal conductivity, the initial and boundary temperatures, and the length and cross-sectional area of the material, and return the temperature distribution across the material.\n",
      "3. Extend the above function to solve unsteady-state (or transient) heat conduction problems. Introduce time as another variable and modify the function to calculate the temperature distribution across the material at different time steps.\n",
      "4. Challenge the students to use their implemented functions to solve real-world heat conduction problems. For example, calculate the temperature distribution in a metal rod heated at one end and cooled at the other end.\n",

      "1. Start by explaining the principles of heat exchanger design, including the concept of heat transfer coefficients, log mean temperature difference, and overall heat transfer coefficient.\n",
      "2. Guide the students to implement a Python function to calculate the required heat transfer area for a given heat exchanger. The function should take as input the heat duty, the heat transfer coefficients of the two fluids, the flow rates and specific heat capacities of the two fluids, and the inlet and outlet temperatures of the two fluids, and return the required heat transfer area.\n",
      "3. Extend the above function to optimize the design of the heat exchanger. Introduce the cost of the heat exchanger as another variable and modify the function to minimize the cost while meeting the heat transfer requirements.\n",

    "2. Extending to Unsteady-State Heat Conduction\n",
    "3. Real-World Problem Solving\n",

    "Again, the notebook sections consisted of pure code cells, with no explanation. The generated solution in section 1 had both conceptual errors and coding errors. For example, the code for 1D steady state heat equation had the following line:\n",

    "```python\n",

    "This failed with `Input operand 1 does not have enough dimentions (has 0)`, when it needs 2: on the left we have a vector of unknowns, so the right-hand-side of the algebraic equation should also be a vector. That's a frank coding error. Moreover, the system matrix is $n \\times n$, and the `temperature` array is of length $n$, so with the slicing the sizes are no longer matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceptual error is that the right-hand side of the steady state heat equation is _not_ equal to $\\alpha T_0$. It should be a vector with zero everywhere (we are solving the Laplace equation), except for the first and last elements, which should reflect the boundary conditions. (There's no concept of \"initial temperature\" if we are solving a steady state problem.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, fixing and expanding the generated solution (a raw and buggy draft!) **requires domain expertise**. However, even though I've never personally taught heat transfer, I was able to fix the errors and expand the explanations in a few hours, producing in the end a useful computational activity for learners in that course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second section of the notebook had a _correct_ solution of the unsteady heat-conduction problem, and the third section was the same as the second but with realistic system parameters. However, in both cases the temperature updates was obtained via a `for`-loop over spatial points, when it could have been better implemented using vectorized array operations, with appropriate slicing."
